Refactoring code for SEO and Accessibility


## Description

With the ever increasing demand for Search Engine Optimization and accessibility, I refactored the exisiting code to meet those needs. This included the following:

* using HTML samantics to define and organize the source code,
* ensuring that styling was organized and exclusive to the CSS file,
* adding alt attributes to images, ensuring headers followed a sequential order, 
* and editing the the title element. 

There were minor changes in the style file to help consildate reoccuring formats. I also added comments to denote specific sections of the page as well as give a high level description of the changes made.

While the content nor styling of the page changed, the changes mentioned above will ensure that the webpage meets accessibility standards.
